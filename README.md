-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Users are who we make programs for. Getting feedback and reacting to the feedback is an important part of improving the project to best help users and attract the most. Sometimes though the user is not so clear as to what they want and just have a general idea. An example of this was the SNHU Travel project. Some users wanted types of vacations. THough the project didn't focus on this, I interpreted it as create a vacation package object. Give it properties like price, location, and keywords of vacation catagories. This isn't what the customer was asking for directly, because they dont know java like the developers do. It is the job of the development team to interpret, or almost translate the user requests and desires to an adaptable framework of code.

-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My method had been to plan out the project, then type it all out and test. As my projects became larger or more complicated I started to plan out the project into several steps. There would be the core, or most essential function, then I would catagorize each in terms of what is most dependant on others and work on each part from there. At each phase I would type it up, test, fix bugs, test again. I think this is mostly an agile methodology of approaching a project. It also gives the ability to adjust certain bits before moving to the next phase. Other key factors that I try to keep in mind are keeping the project modular. I always try to make sure that whatever I am making can be changed with minimal effort in the furure if needed.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Working in a team, especially software requires communication. If the team has a plan of how to implement an idea, and you find that it doesnt work for whatever reason you need to speak up. There is also the instance of being unsure how anothers code works or how to best write a section of your own code. You will need to seek advice out from others. Keeping notes in terms of comments in the code is an incredibly helpful part of the code as going through line by line to understand what is happening is often the not a reasonable approach. Much of this comes down to accountability and when you are given an assignment making sure you do what you need to and talk to who you need to on your team to make sure it gets done in the best way possible, with comments in the code, is your main responsibility. Then sharing how you made your part and possibly why you made it that way.
